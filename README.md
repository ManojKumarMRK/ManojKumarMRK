#HI THERE

I'm an undergraduate computer science student and a Full Stack Developer trying to improve my skillsets.

I had worked with Backend web frameworks like Nodejs, Flask and Django. I had worked with RESTful microservices as well as server side rendered web applications using MVC and MTV 
architecture, worked with both SQL and MongoDB. I also have experience in frontend technologies, created mobile responsive static pages and dynamic templates. 
I had also worked with Reactjs to create SPAs and integrated it with APIs.

Had worked with datas creating insights from it and used machine learning models to predict the outcomes. I use python for working with datas. Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn,
matplotlib are some of my goto libraries.
